# Data Science Salaries Dashboard

## About

This project aims to build a dashboard to visualize data science salaries across the world. Further details can be found in our proposal [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datasci_salaries-R/blob/main/doc/proposal.md).

## Description and sketch

The dashboard shows a world map with the median data science salary of a country encoded in the colour channel. By selecting a country to focus on, a histogram showing the distribution of salaries, a boxplot showing the distribution of salaries per gender, and a 2D-histogram showing the distribution of salaries by age are updated for the specified country. For both the histogram and 2D-histogram plots, x-axis sliders are provided so that users can zoom in on regions of the x-axes that they are interested in. Furthermore, a scatter plot of the salaries for each country is shown on the right.

## Data

To populate our dashboard, the [Kaggle Data Scientists Salaries Around the World](https://www.kaggle.com/ikleiman/data-scientists-salaries-around-the-world) dataset by Iair Kleiman is used. Specifically, the files `conversionRates.csv` and `multipleChoiceResponses.csv` are used in this project. For details about data wrangling, please see [this repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datasci_salaries_py).
